        Located in Flushing, Queens, The COOP offers customers with an incredibly abundant menu filled with a variety of Korean dishes. At The COOP, they are committed in making Korean food that not only drives customers taste buds but also their minds and souls. Some of my all time favorite dishes here include their Kimchi Fried Rice, Truffle Parmesan Fries, Spicy Rice Cakes but most notably they are best for their Korean Fried Chicken dish. Their fried chicken can be served with two different sauces either the Korean Marinate or the Sweet and Chili Sauce or you can even do a combination of half and half. I personally love the korean marinated sauce as it gives a litte kick of spice. If you ever come to visit this place, you must order the Korean Fried Chicken! Moving on, their Spicy Rice Cake dish or better known in the Korean culture as toppoki is an assortment of fish cakes, onions, carrots, ramen and rice cakes all packed with a flavorful and spicy red sauce. This is the perfect dish once again for those spice lovers out there because once you get a taste, you'll be wanting to come back for more. While your enjoying your delicious meal of Korean Food, some drinks that they serve that are must have include their pina colada's and if you're of legal age, they also have an in house bar with an extensive menu of your favorite beers and cocktails. Not only is the food here great but the dining experience is impeccable. The atomsphere is filled with bustling noises of happy customers enjoying a nice dinner out with friends and family or a gathering for a large company party. In addition to this, customer service here has always been incredible as I have never experienced a negative encounter before. They always find the time to come check up on your table and never tries to rush your dinner or conversations.

        Following another one of my favorite restaurants in Flushing, Queens is River Japanese Cuisine restaurant. If you're a sushi lover just like then this is the perfect place for you to check out because they have the best all you can eat menu. The concept of this buffet style service is that every table will get a menu of items they serve for dinner or lunch and you can check off all the items you're entire table wants. Once you put in a slip of orders, you can still continue to order more food as you ask for more slips of menu and all the food is served right to your table. The menu is a combination of original rolls ranging from california, eel avocado, shrimp tempura to teriyaki chicken to fried rice to udon noodles. They even offer incredible side dishes that include seaweed salad, miso soup and kani salad. On top of that, the best part is that they have sashimi included in the dinner menu which is my personal favorite. One of the best distinguishers that River has compared to other sushi restaurants is how fresh and good quality their sushi is. I can easily tell when sushi is good quality based on the taste of their sashimi because that is the main ingredient in sushi. They have a good assortment of sashimi ranging from salmon (my favorite), tuna, yellowtail, mackerel, clams and more. For the price that your paying at around $40 including tips, the buffet is very much worth it. Even the staff and ambiance of the restaurant provides you with the perfect place to enjoy a delicious, private meal with your friends and family.
