    <h2>Brooklyn Museum</h2>
    <p>
        The Brooklyn Museum is one of New York City's largest museums in terms of physical size and holds an art collection with roughly 1.5 million works. Founded in 1895, the museum is located near Prospect Heights, Crown Heights, Flatbush and Park Slope neighborhoods and was designed by Mckim, Mead and White. They had planned for it to be the largest art museum in the entire world. The museum was revitalized in the 20th century with significantly new additions which included Egyptian antiques, Euorpean, African, Oceanic and Japanese arts. American arts are also heavily represented in the museum from collections ranging to include Mark Rothko, Edward Hopper, Edgar Degas, Georgia O'Keeffe, Norman Rockwell and Max Weber. The overall exhibts truly seke to embody artistic heritage of world cultures. The Brooklyn Museum aims to create inspiring encounters with art that expands the ways visitors see themselves, the world and its possibilities. It also aims to showcase great art and encourage conversations that are catalyts for a more connected, civic and empathetic world.

    <h2>My Favorite Exhibits</h2>
        <h3>One: Do Ho Suh</h3>
        <p>
            During a time of mass global migration, the loss of leaving one's native country and searching for a permanent home became a universal issue. This exhibit was one of my favorites simply because of how much I could relate my story to the story of the artist. Being a first generation Chinese American, I can imagine what it feels like to have to find a home in a foreign land as my parents struggled to do so when they arrived in the United States. One: Do Ho Suh was created as a single, large scale work by the Korean born artist named Do Ho Suh. The Perfect Home recreated the artists former apartment in Chelsea, Manhattan as it was his home for 19 years. Visitors were able to walk through the replica and really experience the translucent walls, light fixtures, radiators and intercom that came with the home. The artist aimed to highlight the important connections we individuals make between physical places and memories. This piece was meant to symbolize Suh's ability to carry his houses with him wherever he goes because home is wherever he is. This message is such a powerful reminder to many families who are immigrants and have children that are first generation that home does not always have to be a physical place, it can simply mean where you are most loved and surrounded by people who love you. It is a reminder that even though our parents weren't born in this country, we can still create memories and experience new adventures with them together, here.

        <h3>The Dinner Party by Judy Chicago</h3>
        <p>
            The Dinner Party was an important icon of the 1970s feminist art and a milestone in 20th century arts. It comprised of a massive ceremonial banquet, arranged on a triangular table with a total of 39 place settings, each commemorating an important women from history. This piece intrigued me very much just from the grandeur and massiveness of the structure as well as its message in commemorating women in history. The tables were adorned with porcelain plates, raised central motifs and golden chalices and utensils to render an appropriate style representing individual women being honored. In total, the installation of the table was enhanced even further by rotating Herstory Gallery exhibitions relating to the 1,038 honored women at the table.
