    <h2>The Metropolitan Museum of Art</h2>
    <p>
        The Metropolitan Museum of Art or most notably known as simply the Met is the largest art museum in all of the United States. Founded in 1870, the museum brought art and education of the fine arts to all those who visit from around the world. Located on Fifth Avenue, the museum encompasses a plethora of galleries ranging from The American section opened in 1924 to The Robert Lehman Wing opening in 1975, containing its Old Masters, Impressionists, and Post-Impressionists works. Amongst these sections of the museum also included the addition of the Sackler Wing of the Temple of Dendur in 1978 which houses a monument given by Egypt. In March of 2016, the Met had expanded it modern and contemporary art programs into a Marcel Breuer design building at East 75th Street and Madison Avenue. The Met has a vast amount of important collections including Egyptian, Babylonian, Assyrian, East Asian, Middle Eastern, Greek, Roman, European, pre-Columbian, New Guinean, Islamic and American arts. They are constantly swapping in and out different exhibits throughout the year and this is surely one place you do not want to miss!

    <h2>My Favorite Exhibits</h2>
        <h3>China Through the Looking Glass</h3>
        <p>
            This exhibition explored the impact of Chinese aesthetics on Western fashion and how China has fueled the fashionable imagination for centuries. This exhibit was a combination of The Costume Institute and the Department of Asian Art. The exhibit features over 140 examples of coutre pieces and avant garde ready to wear outfits and designs. So much inspiration from this gallery have inspired fashion designers from all over the world which included Paul Poiret and Yves Saint Laurent. Through the looking glass of fashion, designers conjoin disparate stylistic references into a pastiche of Chinese aesthetic and cultural traditions.

        <h3>The Temple of Dendur</h3>
        <p>
            On April 28, 1967 United States President Lyndon B. Johnson had awarded an ancient Egyption temple built in the first ceutry B.C to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This gift from Egypt stands as one of the most iconic and most visited works of art. The temple shows off a pharaoh praying and providing offerings to the gods followed by a middle room where visitors can see the sanctuary of the goddess Isis. There is a mix of religious and mythological concepts formed into this massive structure. It is important to note that this was built was a way to truly replicate the natural world as the Egyptians knew it.

    <h2>The Met Cloisters</h2>  
    <p>
        The Cloisters are a branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and truly serves as a hidden gem many tourists should come visit. Overlooking the Hudson River, this section of the Museum gets its name from the portions of five medieval clositers incorporated into a modern museum structure. It was designed specifically to evoke the architecture and replicate the later arts of the Middle Ages. Visitors to the cloisters can spot out rich tradition of medieval artisitic production, including metalwork, painting, sculpture and textiles. It even acts as a passageway to galleries and provides an inviting space for people to rest and just admire in awe their surrounding environment. The Cloisters are most prominent for their three gardens known as Cux, Bonnefont and Trie. These are integral features to the Cloisters because they truly enhance that in person experience especially showcasing the elements of Medieval times.
