    <h2 id="anchor1">Playing Sports</h2>
    <p>Throughout my experience in highschool I have always actively played sports. These include swimming, tennis and volleyball.
    And so, during my free time I like to still play these sports in order to destress and be active!
    Here is an image of a game of volleyball which is one of my favorite sports!

    <h2 id="anchor2">Music</h2>
    <p>
    I really enjoy listening to music because its a great way to destress. I enjoy listening to new spotify playlists!

    <h2 id="anchor3">Learning about new cultures</h2>
    <p>
    Learning about new cultures is extremely rewarding and a great way to diversify my experience and perspective!
