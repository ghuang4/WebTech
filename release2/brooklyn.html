        Brooklyn has been a borough of New York City for more than a century and it has been filled with a rich and long history. The first settlement of Brooklyn took place in 1636, when Dutch farmers establushed themselves along the shore of Gowanus Bay. In 1794, Brooklyn was just a small village made up of 100 homes that were scattered all over with no plans of remodeling or residence. Located across the East River from Manhattan, Brooklyn was the portal through which good grown on Long Island passed to reach New York City. During the Revolutionary War, Brooklyn was the site of the important Battle of Long Island. On that same site, Americans built an earthworks fort to protect themselves against the British attack during the War of 1812. In 1814, Robert Fulton began a steam ferry service company across the East River, enabling rich businessmen to commute to work and reside in Brooklyn Heights. During this time of industrial development, there was also a huge influx of Irish immigrants moving to Fort Greene. Many of these immgrants and including others were able to find work in the factories that opened along Brooklyn's waterfront and in the new Navy Yard that opened on Wallabout Bay in 1801. In 1825, the Erie Canal was also completed which added to this era of industrial revolution and economic growth. Many residents of New England even began moving to Brooklyn. Soon after, this once small town had emerged into a city filled with smoking factories along the river, gas lights along public streets and a roaring population of working people. Other notable firsts taking place in Brooklyn were a public school system and an outstanding city hall. Brooklyn's population had nearly doubled between the 1840s, coming a long way from just those 100 small houses. Many of the population consisted of European imigrants with foreign born Irish, British and German families. By 1860, Brooklyn became the third largest city in all of America. Quickly preceding the influx of these migrants came Russian Jews, Italians, Poles, a mixture of Swedes, Norwegians, Danes and Finns by the 1880s. By this time, over one million people resided in Brooklyn and more than 30% were immigrants. Some of the most notable individuals from Brooklyn's history included the editor of Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Walt Whitman later known as one of America's most famous poets and the famous conductor and composer, Leonard Bernstein. In addition to Whitman and Bernstein was actress and comedienne, Mae West. When the 19th century hit, Brooklyn had taken over neighboring distrcits which included Williamsburg and then eventually absorbing every corner of Kings County. In 1898, it surrendered its independent existence by becoming one of New York City's five boroughs. Brooklyn is also connected to Manhattan by three bridges, one vehicular tunnel and several rapid-transit tubes.

        Brooklyn's realized population explosion was extremely notable as new innovations we now today enjoy were created. These included the Williamsburg bridge which was completed in 1903, the first subway line thrusted under the East River in 1908 and the Manhattan Bridge opening in 1909. The urbanization of Brooklyn truly created an environment of appeal to many individuals. Because of the massive rent prices that surged from Manhattan, areas in Brooklyn such as DUMBO, Williamsburg and Greenpoint became very attractive to immigrants and homeowners. Brooklyn is home to many thriving immigrant communities such as those from the Caribbean, Latin America, the former Soviet Union, the Middle East and Asians such as Chinese and Koreans. Brooklyn entertains a multitude of people. You can head to Williamsburg for craft cocktails and vintage threadds or if you are big on family events then visit Prospect Park and Park Slope. This borough has some of the best things New York City has to offer which also includes the diverse taste pallette of restaurants here. Brooklyn has evolved into a global cosmopolitan ambiance of its own, demonstrating a robust, growing demographic emcompassing cultural diversity.
