        Hutaoli restaurant is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in all of New York City! Located near Times Square, Hutaoli music restaurant & bar offers an entirely different dining experience comprised of music, literature and art, Sichuan cuisine and a red wine bar. It has become a landmark of nightlife with cultural elements, engaging many customers to continuously come back. Once entering the restaurant, customers can already get a glimpse of how incredibly well structured the atmosphere is with the high ceilings, greenery and light fixtures. It almost feels as if you are fine dining in a jungle! Some of my all time favorite dishes here include the Lemon Fish Fillet which is comprised of sole with lemon sauce, chinese sauerkeraut and mushrooms. You also have the option to choose your level of spice. They also have an incredible Hutaoli Roast Chicken which is essentially supreme roast chicken with chili and sesame. Even up to the presentation of this dish is impeccable as they serve it in an actualy birds cage and pound the chicken in front of you to get all of the flavors out. Their Dong Bei Style Cabbage, Hutaoli Fried Rice and Honey Shrimp dish are also incredibly delicious. The Honey Shrimp is deep fried shrimp coated in their honey sauce, making it the perfect blend of sweet and savory. All these dishes were made with the purpose of enjoying a family style dinner which means you can get a little taste of every dish and share amongst your friends and family! Never has this place failed to impress me with their music, quality of food and customer serivce and so, the next time you're craving to try Sichuan Cuisine or just something new in your taste palette, be sure to check out Hutaoli Restaurant and Bar!

        After enjoying an incredible dinner at Hutaoli, be sure to check out Sundeas and Cones for dessert! Just a few doors down from the bustling 3rd Avenue, Sundaeas and Cones offers a variety of ice cream flavors and even draws inspiration from Asian inspired flavors such as Thai Iced Tea, Taro and Black Sesame. They also serve the all time classic favorites such as vanilla and chocolate but they make it incredibly tastey! I would always stop by and grab their exotic flavors with my all time favorite combination being the Thai Iced Tea and Taro double scoup on a sugar cone. Their other more interesting flavors that I've loved also includes rose matcha, lychee and green tea. For all your ice cream choices, you have the choice to eat it on a wafer or sugar cone, waffle cone, coated waffle cone or a cup. In addition to ice cream, they also offer beverages such as milk shakes, milk shake floats, malted shakes, ice cream soda, sherbert freeze and egg creams. Their rich flavors are homemade with the most phenomenally smooth and buttery ingredients, making this a place you can continuously count on. Not only are their dessert options the best catch for this place but the fact that they offer taste tests for all flavors of your choice, creates that space of perfect customer service. From all of the ice cream places that I have ever tried, this tops the list at being number 1.
